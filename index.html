    <h4>New  School Canteen</h4>
    <img src="canteen.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The canteen in my school provides students, teachers and other staff with delicious food and drink in hygienic condition. I know that instead of buying things from roadside sellers, it is safe to eat canteen food. Roadside food can spoil our health. I am lucky to have such a good canteen in my school.
      Teachers and other staff members are served by canteen boys in trays. They are served with some light refreshments, tea, coffee, soft drinks, etc. They eat it in their office and staffroom during lunch and short breaks. Even they enjoy canteen food wholehearted.
      Many find our school canteen as a great advantage to both pupils and staff. However, a few PTA members do not think so. They think that school encourages students to spend money on eating outside food.
      Our Principal Mrs. Karbhari is a truthful and straightforward woman. She always likes to put good new ideas into practice. Last month one of the parents in a PTA meeting suggested that there were good chances of improving the services provided by the school canteen. Since then many positive changes have been brought to the canteen
      The quality of the food has improved. It is served fresh and clean. Food is tastier than ever before. Special utensils are used to store food. The variety of food has increased. Most importantly, it is available at many affordable rates.
      My school canteen is run by a staff of people who are well trained and dedicated to preparing food that suits best to the children. On every Thursday, each child gets a free banana from the canteen. Bottles of mineral water are also sold here. Most of the South Indian dishes and dry snacks are available in the canteen. I love to have mendu wada sambhar and plain dosa.
      During recess, there is a great rush. However, students show discipline and are well-mannered. Specially appointed students from senior classes help in maintaining discipline in the canteen. There are few benches in the canteen where at least fifty to sixty students can sit at a time to have their lunch. Everything runs smoothly during recess.
      Sometimes even teachers and other staff members are seen visiting the school canteen. They sit to have their tea, coffee, or some light snacks. Thus, for me canteen in my school must not be considered as a treat but a need because it fills our empty bellies and helps us in making our minds work during studies.

     1. Accuracy:
     As learners, we often equate accuracy with the value of knowledge, however, the value of accuracy is dependent on the area of knowledge under consideration. Today, accuracy in the natural sciences is vital as any error can be catastrophic. In 1986, a flawed reactor and human error caused the Chernobyl disaster  that exposed millions to radiation and had significant long term impacts.  However in history, complete “accuracy” is almost unattainable. 
     <br>
     <br>
     2.Economics:
     Economics is the study of how things are made, moved around, and used. It looks at how people, businesses, governments, and countries choose to use their resources. Economics is the study of how people act, based on the idea that people act rationally and try to get the most value or benefit.
     <br>
     <br>
     3.Productivity/Efficiency:
     High productivity suggests minimum use of resources for achieving a set of targets. Without a set result there is no productivity. Improvement in productivity will result in accomplishment of set targets with relatively lower sacrifice of input resources. Higher the productivity ratio, better it is.
     Productivity should not be confused with production because the latter refers directly to the output while the former relates to the ratio of output in terms of input of materials, labour hours, machine hours, capital employed or any other factor of production. Thus in a broad sense, productivity means goods and services produced in relation to resources utilized in producing the same.</p>
